		</td>
		<td>
		  <p>
			Born in San Francisco, raised in Palo Alto, I was blessed to be
			given the opportunity to witness the Bay Area turn from a pleasant
			place to live into a contemporary techno dystopia. Also, now
			everyone is a web programmer and all I want	to do is systems
			programming.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			My interests are primarily focused in writing programs that run fast
			and do interesting things. If doing the interesting things makes the
			program slow, then it's a problem I'm interested in. Some of the
			projects I have worked on in the past include interpreters,
			compilers, game engines, raytracers and operating system kernels.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			I consider myself a researcher because I have a damned small amount
			of mental memory. I forget important things all of the time but
			fortunately	I've augmented my mind with constant access to the
			internet and Wikipedia.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			In addition to being a red-blooded American, due to my Mother being
			born in London I have a citizenship with the United Kingdom,
			something which will become much less useful when Brexit happens.
